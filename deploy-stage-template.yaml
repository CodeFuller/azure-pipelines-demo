  # However it will break if some intermediate stage is added.
  # That is why it is better to specify dependency explicitly.
  # We do not specify dependency here, because DeployToTest stage will depend only BuildStage and will not depend on DeployToProd stage anymore.
  # This could be fixed by adding DeployToProd to explicit dependencies of DeployToTest, however it become cumbersome since same template is used for both stages.
